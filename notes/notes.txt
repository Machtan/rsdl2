A Window can only have one renderer associated with it (Option<Renderer> ish)
[SDL_Render.c:232]

Most types should probably internally be an Rc-type with a refcell included...
I'm not sure if this will be bad for performance, but it seems the best way
to handle drop deallocation/deinitialization properly.

Destroying a renderer frees the associated textures.

The backbuffer should be considered invalidated after each present; do not assume that previous contents will exist between frames. You are strongly encouraged to call SDL_RenderClear() to initialize the backbuffer before starting each new frame's drawing, even if you plan to overwrite every pixel.
[wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_RenderPresent]

Every window has a pointer to its renderer, and the renderer has a pointer to its window.
