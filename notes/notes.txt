A Window can only have one renderer associated with it (Option<Renderer> ish)
[SDL_Render.c:232]

Most types should probably internally be an Rc-type with a refcell included...
I'm not sure if this will be bad for performance, but it seems the best way
to handle drop deallocation/deinitialization properly.

Destroying a renderer frees the associated textures.
